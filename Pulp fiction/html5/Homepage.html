<h3>Project Summary</h3>
		 
Pulp fiction is one of the best crime films. 
I will be using a scene from the film which I will turn into a comic. 
The comic will be presented within a website.</br>
<h3>Target Audience </h3>
The site will be directed to a wide range of audience but it will be 18+ as there is a lot of graphic scenes. 
It will be specifically targeted to pulp fiction fans and anyone who is interested in crime/drama films.</br> 
<h3>Look and feel</h3>
The tone of the of the film is very dark and gritty so the comic and the website will be dark. 
I will also use the colour red in the website for the header which represents blood. 
I will also add the colour grey to show the grimness of the film.
The film has very tense moments so in my comic I will try to represent that by being suspenseful.
